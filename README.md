    <p>This is a python file to translate your text file into any other language. All you need to do is:</p>

       <li>Download this file.</li>
       <li>Copy the file you want to translate in the same directory as this python file.</li>
       <li>And change the name of your file to 'Original_Text.txt' and run the python file.</li>
       <li>You will see a new file genrated by this program as 'Translated_text.txt' in the same directory. You can rename it and use it however you want.</li>
     </ol>
  </li>

    <p>If you want to change the language other than japanese, just change the language code at line 3: from 'ja' to 'any language you want'. To check the code for the language you want, you can visit to this <a href="https://devguide.python.org/documentation/translating/" target="_blank">link </a> </p>
